# Podil, because sharing is caring
This was a book sharing web app. Now it is a search engine that combines videos from [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com), metadata from  [...] and lyrics (when possible) from [MusixMatch](http://musixmatch.com/)   
I am doing this for the indextank [holiday hack contest](http://blog.indextank.com/93/holiday-hacks-indextank-heroku/) 
so we'll see how that goes!   
Happy Holidays to everyone and good luck to the participants!

## Steps
