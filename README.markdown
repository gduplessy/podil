# Podil, because sharing is caring
This was a book sharing web app. Now it is a search engine that combines videos from [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com), metadata from  [...] and lyrics (when possible) from [MusixMatch](http://musixmatch.com/)   
I am doing this for the indextank [holiday hack contest](http://blog.indextank.com/93/holiday-hacks-indextank-heroku/) 
so we'll see how that goes!   
Happy Holidays to everyone and good luck to the participants!

## Steps
* Learn Rails, build the structure. [X]   
Yes I am learning Rails while doing this project 
and the one in the [Rails Tutorial Book](http://railstutorial.org/).   

* Implement Youtube's API in the app [X]   

* Add lyrics in the app [X]   

* Add Metadata (title, author, length, places to buy[?]).   
Other music by the same artist (list). [/]

* Implement IndexTank API   

* Make it look good   

* Add [:flash] for when there's no youtube video (or play next on the list and so on?)
